To compile our code, you can simply used the supplied Makefile by typing:
make

This will compile our page rank implementation and our page rank implementation
that has a different work partition (slightly less efficient). If you would like
to compile this yourself without the Makefile, you can do as follows:
mpicc -o main PageRank.c Lab4_IO.c -g -Wall -lm
mpicc -o alternate PageRankDifferentPartition.c Lab4_IO.c -g -Wall -lm

This program is called with no commandline arguments. To run it using MPI,
use:
mpirun -np <desired number of processes> ./main
